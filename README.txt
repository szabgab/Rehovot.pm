Site Maintenance:

- Edit the templates in the templates/ directory.
- Add any static files to the site/ directory but do not add .html files here.

- Run perl script/build.pl    this will generate the .html files in the site/ directory

- Upload the newly added static files and the newly generated .html files
  from site/ to the real site (by Jaime or by Gabor):
